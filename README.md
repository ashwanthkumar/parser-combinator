# Parser Combinator

After a discussion on optimizing some of the RegexParsers I was writing, one of my mentor (yellowflash) asked me to 
implement a RegexParser on my own by hand on paper and code. We did it on paper together. This is my attempt at trying
to write a RegexParser in Scala with which one can implement more parsers.
